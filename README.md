[GUI Widgets Classification based on Neural Architecture Search](#)

Graphical User Interface (GUI) widget classification is gaining much attention in the software engineering community. Prior works mainly adopted mature methods from the computer vision domain that employed manually designed network architectures to classify the GUI widgets. Unfortunately, manually designing good architecture is often time-consuming and requires a certain level of expertise. Therefore, there is a need for an approach to automate the architecture design. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatically generating a GUI widget classification architecture. The proposed method, termed NASGW, uses Neural Architecture Search (NAS) capabilities to automatically generate a high-performance classification architecture based on a labeled widget dataset. Several experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method on a large-scale widgets dataset with over 235k samples.  The experimental results show that our method obtained the best architecture in less than an hour based on the given dataset. Also, when it comes to training, our architecture is 3x faster than the comparative method. The results also show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets, achieving an F1 score of 90% on the original dataset and precision of 92% on the standard dataset. In addition, the performance of the proposed method increases steadily with an increase in training data. Therefore, the proposed method automatically generates the widget classification architecture and reduces the time taken to design the architecture. Meanwhile, the generated architecture achieved better performance than traditional hand-crafted architectures.
